#### Brief Introduction

1. <b>Clarify:</b>
   1. Ask following questions to interview in case of specific problems
      1. What is the business objective of the segmentations?
      2. Is the application for product research or marketing?
      3. Should I focus on customers across Apple's business or within a specific business such as Apple Pay or Apple Music?

2. <b>Constrain:</b>
   1. The open-ended problem into a key objective.
      1. "Based on your clarifications, I will focus on segmenting users based on subscription services such as Apple Music, Apple TV+ and iCloud. The purpose is to help Apple's marketing team create customer profiles that can help then perform target marketing."

3. <b>Plan:</b> 
   1. Take a minute or two to frame your response:
      1. "I'd like to take a minute to gather my thoughts on a solution if that's okay with you"
      2. "To address this problem, I would like to discuss data preparation, statistical method and a business recommendation. Are you okay with this?"

4. <b>Method:</b> 
   1. Explain your methodology step by step
      1. "First, I need to prepare data that are useful for the segmentations, I could use user profile, user behaviour, and marketing engagement data"
      2. "Next, I will apply feature engineering to extract useful signals. For instance, I could extract the # of active sessions per Apple Music in the past 30 days. I can repeat the feature engineering on other subscription services.Such signals can help create what types of services a user typically uses"
      3. Algorithm: "With the features identified, I can apply a clustering algorithm such as the K-means. I can use the Elbow technique to find the optimal number of clusters. Finally, I can interpret each cluster using descriptive statistics to create user profiles"

5. <b>Conclude:</b>
   1. Conclude by relating the methodology to the business problem
      1. "With the clusters identified, I can provide a description of each cluster type. For instance, if a cluster contains users with low-frequency active sessions across Apple's services, the marketing team could send a targeted email campaign to encourage users to stay engaged on the services."

   2. **Ideate a solution** - On a Word Doc, a sheet of paper or whiteboard, jot down ideas on how you would approach it.
   3. **Explain the solution out loud** - In 5 minutes or less, explain the solution out loud.
3. Mock Interview
