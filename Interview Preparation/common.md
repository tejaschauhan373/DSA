* Currently, I am software engineer at Kevit Technologies in Rajkot, Gujarat, I have experience of 1 year and 3 months of software engineering including 1 year as softeware engineer intern and 3 months as software engineer
* From the internship, I am contributing may project, but I will describe about one project on which I have contributed from scratch which is type of fraud detection and web data collection
* We have build one system which monitors social media pages 24*7 hours & help us to find the content that we want
* In this project, we have faced many challenges but significant were system design & automation
* I can describe the challenges by example, 
* Currently, you are monitoring  one social media platform facebook,
& now you have requirements to monitor other social media platform twitter & instagram
* So, project system should be built in such way that you can integrate as many as social media platform without too much change in system & code
* So, We have build master slave architecture which is well known distributed system and fullfill our all the requirements
* So, it's efficient to integrate other platform and scalable & if one part of distributed system is broken then it can't affect all the system that's major advantages of distributed system
* But when you come to master slave distributed architecture, you have to maintain & monitor your system
* Let's take one example if one component of system is broken, you should notify by the system for this type of error
* So, we have implemented one dashboard with analytics from that you can monitor all the system and get the status of current system easily
* Also, We have implemented Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery in it.
* Apart from that I have made many middlewares in other live projects like API integrations of Microsoft Calendar, CRMs
* Also done feasibility checking of projecs related Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning
