1. Series and Sequence
    1. Find the kth terms of series
       A(k) = A(1) + (k - 1)d
       
    2. Sum of N number
        Sum of n terms of AP = n/2 [2a + (n â€“ 1)d]
        
        Sum of n terms = n (a + nth term of series) / 2
       
        where a = first element of series
              n = total element of series
              d = difference between two elements
